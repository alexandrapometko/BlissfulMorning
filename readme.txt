Morning Routine helper

Guides you through your morning routine. You can add tasts, set a time for each one of them, a custom ringtone.
There are also default routines built in, ie the standart "Miracle Morning".

For each task, a minimalistic page explains what the task is about. 
For eg, "Meditation" would be "Observe yourself breathing in and breathing out, and non-judgmentally come back to that state when your mind wanders."

You start the routine and for each task, there is a timer, which you can pause if you want.
When a task is done, a non-stressful ringtone tells you to move on to the next task.

It must have a very good user experience and induce feelings of positivity and well-being to the user.
